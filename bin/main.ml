	Questions
		1. Design a new type rect for representing rectangles. Treat squares as a special case.
		2. Now write a function of type rect â†’ int to calculate the area of a given rect.
		3. Write a function which rotates a rect such that it is at least as tall as it is wide.
		4. Use this function to write one which, given a rect list, returns another such list which has the
			smallest total width and whose members are sorted narrowest first.
		5. Write take, drop, and map functions for the sequence type.
		6. Extend the expr type and the evaluate function to allow raising a number to a power.
		7. Use the option type to deal with the problem that Division_by_zero may be raised from the
			evaluate function.
